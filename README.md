## Architecture
Uses concepts of the notorious Uncle Bob's architecture called [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).</br>

* Better separation of concerns. Each module has a clear API., Feature related classes life in different modules and can't be referenced without explicit module dependency.
* Features can be developed in parallel eg. by different teams
* Each feature can be developed in isolation, independently from other features
* faster compile time

## Modules:
* **app** - It uses all the components and classes releated to Android Framework. It gets the data from presentation layer and shows on UI. (**access all the modules**)
* **core** - Module contains all the resuable compose component and other util classes.
* **feature_note** - Module contains all the classes and interface used to add edit and delete note screen.
* **feature_settings** - Modules contains all the classes and interface used for settings screen
