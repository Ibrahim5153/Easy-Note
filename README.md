# Easy Note
Easy Note: Notes app using JetPack Compose and MVVM with a clean architecture approach.

This app shows the usage of the new Navigation Architecture Component in collaboration with the Jetpack Compose.

**App features:**
- List of Notes
- Add Edit Notes
- Delete Notes
- Light/ Dark theme.
- Custom font.

## Architecture
Uses concepts of the notorious Uncle Bob's architecture called [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).</br>

* Better separation of concerns. Each module has a clear API., Feature related classes life in different modules and can't be referenced without explicit module dependency.
* Features can be developed in parallel eg. by different teams
* Each feature can be developed in isolation, independently from other features
* faster compile time

## Modules:
* **rick-and-morty-ui** - It uses all the components and classes releated to Android Framework. It gets the data from presentation layer and shows on UI. (**access all the modules**)
* **data** - The data layer implements the repository interface that the domain layer defines. This layer provide a single source of truth for data. (Kotlin module that **can only access domain module**)
* **remote** - Handles data interacting with the network. (**can only access data module**)
* **cache** - Handles data interacting with the local storing (Room DB). (**can only access data module**)
* **domain** - The domain layer contains the UseCases that encapsulate a single and very specific task that can be performed. This task is part of the business logic of the application. (Kotlin module that **cannot access any other module**)
* **presentation** - MVVM with ViewModels exposing LiveData that the UI consume. The ViewModel does not know anything about it's consumers. (Android module that **can only access domain module**)

## Tech stack - Library:

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) - Flow is used to pass (send) a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously
- [Dagger-Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - for dependency injection.
- [Kotlin-DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) - Used to handle gradle dependencies and config versions
- JetPack
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - For reactive style programming (from VM to UI). 
  - [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle) - Used get lifecyle event of an activity or fragment and performs some action in response to change
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
  - [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - Used to create room db and store the data.
  - [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) - Used to navigate between fragments
- [Material-Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Material design components like ripple animation, cardView.

## TODO
- [ ] CI/CD (Github Actions, Bitrise, CircleCI)
- [ ] Unit test
- [ ] Jacoco for test coverage
- [ ] Ktlint or Detekt
